# DistributedSystems

## 8 fallacies of distributed systems

- [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacies_of_distributed_computing)
- The network is reliable - make sure your code is resilient to network failure.
- Latency is zero
- Bandwidth is infinite
- The network is secure
- Topology doesn't change - single database is an example of this. Be prepared for database failovers and/or distributed databases.
- There is one administrator
- Transport cost is zero
- The network is homogeneous - happens when the system is designed so two different applications need to be deployed at the same time. Take care of versioning to mitigate this.

## Properties of reliable systems

- Idempotence
- Immutability
- Location independence
- Versioning
- These properties are discussed in detail below. The reason for these properties is they mitigate the fallacies we highlighted above: the network is reliable (idempotence), topology doesn't change (location independence) and the network is homogeneous (versioning).
- The above properties can be applied to any system, they are not meant necessarily for distributed systems. Applying these principles will bring value to any type of system.

### Idempotence

- Networks are not reliable. If you don't get back a successful reply, you cannot discern between the server not getting the message, an error on the server and server executing successfully but the response somehow getting lost.
- Our system must be prepared to detect a duplicate write and ignore it.
- We do this by generating a client-side generated id and then POSTing (and PUTing, but PUT is idempotent as it is) against that identifier. Guid is a good choice for this. This will act as an alternate key in the database.
- In the course [Fundamentals of Distributed Systems](https://app.pluralsight.com/course-player?clipId=d4145cd4-2477-4a20-ae65-af9476ef06fc) Michael Perry also talks about not returning the Id back to the client. Not sure what that is about. An implication of this is that the client will use the client Id to query the resource and this decision then permeates the interfaces found throughout the application layers.
- There are a few other ways to make sure duplicate messages do not cause issues:
  - Message broker can be configured so as to detect duplicate messages. This operation usually hinges on having a `MessageId` of some sort in the message, which must be the same across two messages.
  - Write the system's logic in a way that it is idempotent. E.g. do not have the message saying "add 10 to total amount" but rather say "total amount should be 60". This seems case specific.

### Immutability

- Never change the entity, but rather add a new record. Benefits:
  - We have a natural audit log
  - Nothing gets destroyed
  - We preserve what data each node received ("metadata")
  - Promotes eventual consistency (not sure how immutability relates to this one?)
- Immutability changes everything [here](https://vimeo.com/52831373)
- Facilitated by:
  - Snapshot pattern - a separate snapshot table keeping each change, thus simulating updates. Besides keeping the data it also allows for detecting concurrent writes by comparing the incoming tick number with the last stored tick number. The caller must provide the exact same tick number otherwise they are working with an out-of-date version. Important thing to note here is the concurrency boundary begins when the data is read. More on my discussion with Michael Perry in the bottom of this article [here](#Discussion-with-Michael-Perry-on-snapshot-pattern-and-concurrency-checks).
  - Tombstone pattern is used to simulate deletes.

### Location independence

- Location dependent identifiers like auto-incrementing Ids are an anti-pattern in distributed systems: One record cannot be moved from one database to another because the id might be taken by another record.
- To maintain location independence you should hide or even not use auto-incrementing IDs. Use client generated IDs.
- Location independent identifiers:
  - Alternate Key
  - Natural Key
  - Public Key
  - Hash - a.k.a. Content Addressed Storage, using the content to identify itself. This value is the same irrelevant of which node does the calculation.
    - One use is to do cache busting for client-side cached components (e.g. JS files). However, if caching is done based on query string (`file.js?v=123`), then this does not play well with rolling deployments where we might have multiple versions of `file.js` deployed - request for `file.js?v=456` will bust the local cache, but the load balancer will still forward the request to one of the deployed versions of the application and it might not necessarily be the one where `file.js?v=456` is stored, thus potentially retrieving an older version (`file.js?v=123`) and causing the browser to store the wrong version as `file.js?v=456`. If we name our resources according to the hash derived from the resource (`file-123.js`) than cache busting will work with multiple versions deployed.
    - Advantages:
      - Naturally immutable: if the hash is different, it's a different object.
      - Naturally verifiable: if the hash you calculate does not match the hash of the object you just received, it has been tampered with.
      - Naturally idempotent: if the hash of the object you hold is the same as the hash of the object you want to replace, no need to replace it.
      - Solves cache invalidation: if the cache contains an object with a given hash, you know it's up to date. More [here](https://app.pluralsight.com/course-player?clipId=26c73001-f898-4ea0-a6aa-2cc41fe14185).

### Versioning

#### Code versioning

- Source control management software (Git)
- CI/CD pipeline and separate components for versioning assemblies

#### Database versioning

- When versioning the database (e.g. new columns) favour creating new tables as opposed to just adding new columns. By just adding new columns we have to make them nullable or provide a default value to accomodate existing records - this sends a message that all records have this default value (which is probably not true) or that the columns is optional. By creating a new table we are sending a clear message - data is optional. Of course if the new columns are not optional, consider including them in the existing tables, but think about how that relates to the nature of having immutable records.

#### API versioning

- One of the fallacies of distributed computing says "Network is homogenous". What this means is that we erroneously might believe all the nodes out there are of the same version (e.g. all instances of some specific service are of the same version). This is not true if we want to have things like rolling deploys and backwards compatibility.
- Versioning plays into this by allowing us to maintain contracts across different versions of applications across different locations and different times these are deployed.
- Versioning can be achieved through several approaches:
  - HTTP headers: `Accept=application/some_resource.v1+json`, `Content-Type=application/some_resource.v1+json`
  - Query string: `/api/some_resource?version=v1`, but this kind of defeats the purpose of query string
  - Route: `/api/v1/some_resource`
  - Additive versioning: different versions of the API work with different versions of the payload. Newer versions simply know how to read additional properties in the payload.
  - Or you can avoid it altogether by using GraphQL, allowing the clients to shape their own responses.

### Open points

- Why are we hiding Id from clients?
  - Answer by Michael L. Perry:
    - There are two reasons that I recommend against returning the database-generated ID from the server. The first is to discourage it from being used in subsequent requests. If you need the database-generated ID to update the venue, for example, then you would need to wait for the creation to complete. This constrains you to an architecture where the client is temporally coupled to the server. It cannot continue until the server responds. That makes asynchronous services and occasionally-connected clients difficult to implement.
    - The second reason is to allow the server to switch from one database to another. If you have an active stand-by, for example, then you would end up with different IDs for the same GUID. The client should not be able to see that such as switch has taken place.
- Benefits of immutable data?
- Content Addressed Storage - how does load balancer know where to find `file-123.js` as opposed to `file-456.js`?

### Discussion with Michael Perry on snapshot pattern and concurrency checks

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26722936/140316543-f75669ff-62ad-41a0-9c6c-2cd912918aa2.png)

## Connecting Services

### Types of messages

#### Commands

- Clients tell the system of record to perform some action. As a rule commands should return any value.

#### Queries

- Clients ask the system of record to return some data. As a rule queries should not change anything.

#### Events

- Emitted by the system of record to signal an action was performed resulting in change of the system's internal state. As a rule should be expressed in past tense.

### Temporal Coupling

#### Synchronous Coupling

- HTTP, gRPC, REST, SOAP
- Allows the delivery to take place and server to validate the incoming payload, do the processing and return the result indicating how the processing went.
- Commands can be done using a synchronous manner, but then the client and the server are temporaly coupled, which is something we should strive to avoid. Benefits are the client is informed whether the command went through successfully or not.
- Queries should use synchronous coupling, but in specific cases (e.g. performance) they can be executed using an asynchronous call.

#### Asynchronous Coupling

- HTTP (202 Accepted), AMQP, Apache Kafka, Amazon SQS and others
- Allows the delivery to take place and server to validate the incoming payload. Business invariant cannot be checked, but information can be returned to the client on how to check in later.
- Commands should be done using an asynchronous communication. Client should be returned a 202 Accepted and the processing should be done in the background as this decouples the client from the server. This does make the system more complicated overall as the client now has to check back to see the result of the processing.
- Events should be done asynchronously because the system of record is publishing these to let others know it has finished an action - it is not interested in who picks up the message and therefore decoupling is paramount.

### Publishing Contract Packages

- For services to communicate asynchronously they need to know which events each of them works with - events form an interface.
- To stay on top of the interfaces and any changes that might happen to these interfaces a service should publish events it works with (consumes). This is best done by creating a separate project describing the events and make it part of same solution as the consuming service. Publish the contract package to NuGet (private feed) so other services know what the events should like. Use semantic versioning to convey information whether the new interface introduces a breaking change.
- The section below talks about how to keep track of Dtos, but a different approach is suggested there. Since the above approach is suggested by Michael Perry and the approach below by Roland Guijt, I still have to see if the two are in conflict.

#### API Data Transfer Objects

- You might be tempted to share Dtos used by microservices, but don't do that. This leads to tight coupling between microservices.
- Another option is generating Dtos from OpenApi specification. If you are ok with the generated code, it's a viable approach. Updating the Dtos is now done manually.
- Third option is to simply for each service to have its own copy of Dtos and go with that. Updating the Dtos is now done manually.

#### Generating Data Transfer Objects

- This approach utilizes OpenApi specification and tooling to generate Dtos. If you are ok with the generated classes and they way they look like, this is an ok approach.
- Otherwise, you might have to resort to manually creating the Dtos as per the specification - there are tools online for this as well, so you just c/p resulting classes.

### Integrating external Partners

- This section describes how external clients might integrate with your distributed system.
- Use HTTP in an asynchronous manner, returning 202 Accepted. This way you can avoid temporaly coupling with your partner's APIs and you also sidestep a few other issues your partners might have with publishing messages to your messaging queue:
  - Messaging queues tend to be implementation based and not standards based (see list above, they are all products, not standards).
  - Authentication issues by 3rd parties.
- By using HTTPs you can also:
  - Create OpenAPI specification for your partners to consume.
  - Utilize your platform's API Management tools to issue API keys your partners can use to authenticate.
  - Create Postman collections and reference implementations for your partners to integrate more easily.

## Connecting Microservices

### Commutativity

- It is a real possibility two messages which have been queued in a specific order might be processed out of order. Therefore it is important for our system to be able to process them out of order and yet have the desired result happen.
- An example is first creating a new show for an act (show added event) and then renaming that act (act description changed event). This was important for Perry's search service. When the act is renamed all shows get the new name. When a new show is created the act name is embedded in the event. If these two events get processed the other way round then first all the shows belonging to the specific act get renamed and only then the new show will be created, but with the old name. He solved the problem by indexing the act name in a separate index. This way any show created can read the last indexed act name from the act index and compare to the act name in the show added event - if the indexed act name is newer, use that - if the indexed act name is older, replace with the act name from the show added event. This approaches hinges on the act index storing metadata (last modified date).
- I think details on how to implement commutativity are very case-specific.

## Why use microservice architecture at all?

- Flexible scaling
- Independent deployment
- Team separation
- Easy to expand
- Reliable
- Different technologies: languages, types of interfaces (REST, gRPC)

## Tracing

- Every incoming HTTP request should get the web framework to generate an identifier. ASP.NET Core implements the HTTP Trace Context standard.

## Saga

- Essentially a distributed transaction that executes as a series of local database transactions.
- Consists of three phases executed consecutively:
  1. Compensatable transactions - these can be reverted by applying transactions that cancel out original transactions.
  2. Single pivot transaction - last compensatable transaction which can still possibly fail. If it fails compensatable transactions must be reverted.
  3. Retriable transaction - cannot be reverted using compensatable transactions. Must be retried until they finally succeeded.
- Are ACD (not ACID). Lack of isolation leads to dirty reads until the whole saga is finished. Some steps can be taken to mitigate dirty reads through countermeasures - these are design techniques that make the saga more ACID-like. An example is a Semantic Lock - it is an application level lock saying don't read or update this object (i.e. it is a new column or property on a database row or object).

### Communication and Coordination

- Respective services need to communicate with one another to pass commands and queries. Having one service call another synchronously (over HTTP) makes for brittle communication - availability suffers because if one services in the chain goes down or timeouts, entire operation fails.
- The solution to above problem is to use a message broker with at-least-once delivery. This way a saga will work even if participants are down. Another interesting property a message broker should have is ordered delivery - this way we can scale consumers and preserve ordering.
- Return a response from the API to the client before Saga finishes. Let them know how to fetch more data on how the Saga is progressing.
- Coordination options (choreography and orchestration) are described below.
- Most resilient communication pattern is sending messages between services. An issue with this approach is: what if, after we finish the database transaction locally, we cannot contact the messaging queue?
- Approaches below have in common saving the event locally and then having it read from the store and sent to the remote service.

#### Event Sourcing

- Sequence of events is stored in event store and a handler publishes to message broker.
- Example: [Event sourcing database](https://www.eventsource.com)

#### Transactional Outbox pattern

- Insert into an `Outbox`/`IntegrationEvent` table as part of your transaction. A separate process reads from the database and sends it to the remote service.
- Reading from the database can be done by having a dedicated process utilize transaction log tailing (reading from the transaction log through database-specific APIs). This approach is very database specific. It is most efficient of Transactional Outbox pattern approaches.
- Another way to read the database for new events is to poll the `Outbox` table. This approach is universal because it does not depend on any database-specific APIs, but there is the question of how frequently we want to poll the database to not overtax it too much.
- After the message is sent, the reading process marks it as such.
- My guess is this approach should not be limited to just integration events, but command messages as well.
- Look into eventstoredb for a potential implementation, but I not quite sure we could support doing it all in one transaction?

### Saga influences API design

- Sagas are initiated using a POST request to an API. The question is: when do we send the response back to the caller?
- Several options exists:
  1. Send response after the saga finishes:
  - Keeps the API unchanged, but introduces runtime coupling because the caller must wait on the saga to finish.
  - All saga participants must be online. This reduces availability of the whole system.
  2. Send response immediately after starting the saga:
  - Recommended approach.
  - Higher availability as there is no runtime coupling.
  - API will need to be changed since the response does not specify the result of the operation.
  - Client will have to poll the system for result or be notified some other way (push notifications?).

### Choreography

- Event driven - coordination logic is distributed among participants.
- Participants publish event and consumers react. Lacks a centralized place where the logic is stored - hard to reason about (in complex sagas), but simple to implement.
- Relies on events:
  - Typically DDD domain events.
  - A change to DDD aggregate. Inidicated something that happened and that is of interest to domain experts.
  - Recommended approach on what to store in an event says to store everything the consumer needs:
    - It's more self-sufficient and does not require callbacks from consuming services.
    - Does introduce design-time coupling as both producing and consuming service need to coordinate, thus providing less stability.
    - Removes the inconsistency risk - if we were to send only an entity identifier in the event there would be a chance the entity changed in the period between the consuming service receiving the event and issuing a callback to the producing service.
  - Another approach on what to store in an event is just the minimal - entity identifier. This requires the consumer to call the oiginating service, thus introducing runtime coupling. There is a risk of inconsistenncy: original data may have changed since the event was published.
- Utilizes a pub-sub principle with potentially many subscribed consumers. The producing service doesn't know which services are listening for events.

### Orchestration

- Saga orchestrator is a dedicated class (e.g. `CreateOrderSaga`) that calls participating services in turn. It uses asynchronous request-response via message broker. Saga orchestrator is a **persisted** object that implements a state machine and invokes the participants. Gets stored in the database waiting for the response to come in. Once a reply comes in it gets retrieved from persistence store and continues executed: calls next participant, updates its own internal state, persists its own internal state and waits for the next reply to come in.
- The saga orchestrator object gets created by the service itself.
- Due to it being a state machine you will probably need an orchestration framework of some sort.
- Utilizes point-to-point communication channel where the message and the channel are owned by the consuming service.

## Cross-cutting concerts

### Health Checks

- Check all dependencies of the project: message broker, database, etc...
- You can also check downstream APIs and services whether they are healthy (check out the package `AspNetCore.HealthChecks.Uris`. However, this approach is risky because it opens you up to cascading failures. It is appropriate only for the most critical services. In such cases, if downstream services are not healthy, it's best to mark your service's readiness status as `Degraded` instead of `Unhealthy`. For most situations, though, it is best not to couple your services health status to downstream services, but rather let the orchestrator handle such situations through monitoring and health checks of those downstream services.
- A good thing to test is whether message broker's topics and queues are reachable. You can even mark the service as `Unhealthy` if the broker is not reachable.

## Documenting distributed systems

### Good engineering practices

- The practices mentioned here are elaborated in the next section. They are here to provide overview in one place.
- Runbook - make it part of your development culture to write stuff to runbook:
  - Write to runbook as you develop code.
  - Regularly verify the runbook with you QA team.
  - Updated with each new release.
- Queues - ops team should maintain good practices:
  - Have a monitoring dashboard to keep an eye on metrics.
  - Periodically take a baseline of the above metrics and record that in the runbook. Use it to detect anomalies.
  - Have a ticketing system so messages in DLQ can be quickly resolved.
- Logging and tracing:
  - Standards should be specified in the runbook - what is logged, how is it logged and how is correlated tracing done.
  - Logging code should be a target of code reviews, to make sure useful stuff gets logged.
  - Document a query (in the runbook) allowing the ops and QA teams to find logs they need in the logging management system. Developers should work with QA on these queries to make sure the queries provide valuable results.

### Runbook

- Maintain a runbook of your system. It should contain information of value to operators, DBAs, developers, testers.
- It is a living document about how your system looks like and how to run in.
- Describe different aspects of your system: databases, application dependency map, how to mitigate known problems, maintain queue metrics.

#### Application databases

- Describe the ERD in a general sense (do not include each column for brevity).
- Describe which tables are expected to grow.
- List long running queries.
- In general, whatever DBA might need so as not to fly blind.

#### Application dependency map

- Create a diagram of externally visible applications. Essentially, these are any web or mobile applications your end users will use. Do not let the work "externally" fool you, it should also include applications used internally by your organization.
- Create a diagram any internal APIs the above applications dependend on. Who depends on whom?
- Describe how these application are hosted, machines, ports, OS, machine names etc...
- How are the applications and APIs configured? Where is the configuration: environment variables or a configuration service? How to change it? How does one machine find another: is there a discovery service or are machine IPs configured statically?
- Describe how the message brokers work, what the topics and queues are named, who is expected to subsribe to each.
- When creating the diagram, show each node:
- Is it publically accessible?
- What URL is it reachable on?
- What port?
- Which message broker and queue/topic does it use? What does it listen to?
- Which other node does it depend on?

#### Problems and mitigations

- Problems in production will arise as time goes by. Log them here as they show up and describe how it was solved.
- Is the problem a technical debt? Log it as such.
- Some issues might require a cross-functional research team: network people, DBAs, developers, ops.

#### Queue metrics

- Each broker has different way metrics are measured. Describe the most important metrics relevant to your broker. Reading the metrics correctly will tell you if there is a problem or if you need to do scaling up or down.
- Message delivery - number of messages in each stage of delivery:
- Number of ready messages: should be close to 0. If it starts to go up, it means there is a bottleneck downstream.
- Number of unacknowledged messages: should be close to 0. If it starts to go up, it means the consumer it taking a long time to process each message. It might also mean the message is failing to get processed and the consumer is in an exponential backoff.
- Number of delivered messages: should increase over time. Indicated a total throughput of the system.
- Brokers run on nodes, just like any other service. Node health should be monitored as well:
  - CPU
  - Memory
  - Storage
  - Sockets
- Nodes are in cluster, allowing the system to achieve availability and scalability. Clusted usage should be monitored as well:
  - Connections
  - Channels
  - Queues
  - Consumers
- Monitoring and dashboard tools available: Prometheus, Grafana, Kibana.
- Periodically take a baseline of the above metrics and record that in the runbook. Use it to detect anomalies.

#### Dead Letter Queues

- A strategy is needed for handling messages in DLQ:
  - Alert: at a minimum, an alert is needed whenever anything ends up in DLQ.
  - Locate: a message ending in the DLQ is usually a sign of a problem somewhere else, like a consumer failing to properly process a message. The source of the problem will have to be located by the ops team by figuring out where the message came from - looking at the application dependency map in the runbook is the best way to go about it.
  - Diagnose: why did the service fail to process the message right now? Is something wrong with the message? Has the service been updated recently? Does a service's dependency cause issues (availability, processing error)?
  - Correct
  - Restore: bring the message back into the appropriate queue/topic.
  - Monitor: monitor the handler to make sure the message is processed after the fix.
  - Document: write down the findings in the runbook if they are not noted already.

#### Logging

- When logging an exception, log as much context as you can. Have the operations in mind - they will read the log entry and try to rebound from the error.
- Write logging practices in the runbook and make sure any code relating to logging is code reviewed during PRs.
- Logging proposal:
  - Entry points:
    - Log all inputs (before parsing) - info level
    - If input data contains a lot of details, log the details separately - debug level
    - Log return message so you know what was returned and how long it took - debug level
  - Exit points:
    - Outgoing message (any API call or message sent) - info level, so as to have a basic timing mechanism
    - Optional debug details - debug level
    - Log return message - debug level
  - Storage:
    - Log every time you access the database. Log SQL and parameters - debug level
  - Domain core decisions:
    - Log any decision made in the domain core. No need to log when you have basic CRUD logic, but do log when you have a more complex business logic. Log parameters that went into making the decision - info level.
    - Log exceptions - error level

#### Correlated tracing

- Allows operations to patch together logs from different services.
- Write a query allowing the ops and QA teasm to find logs they need in the logging management system.

## Application Gateway

- A separate component in the distributed system architecture. The point is to have a centralized API through which the client applications can communicate with the backend distributed system. This way we simplify the client application by decoupling it from the backend architecture and relieving it from having to know about each microservice. At the same time, application gateway allows our microservice architecture to evolve freely because only the application gateway knows about the inner workings.
- All incoming communication should go through the application gateway.
- Application gateway should also participate in executing queries across services, this reduces the chatiness between the client application and the backend system. Client should issue one request and the gateway should communicate with all the relevant services.
- Make sure not to put too much logic in the gateway. Think of it as a Backend-for-frontend (BFF) - each client application should have its own BFF written with only that client application in mind.
- Other uses: SSL termination, rate limiting, load balancing...

## Security

- This section describes three use cases:
  - Client application trying to access the services.
  - One service trying to talk to another service.
  - One service talking to one or more services through a message broker.
- Several approaches are presented, starting with a simple one - client having a single token for all services. Then we show how the client could have a separate token for each service. We demonstrate how an API Gateway fits into the picture and it usefulness with doing token exchanges. This leads us to demoing how each services can be protected by a dedicated token. We will also discuss tradeoffs between the number of clients and the number of tokens.
- We also discuss how HTTPS should be used even on private networks.
- We will talk about how to secure communication going through a message broker.
- Lastly we will discuss token stores.
- Main takeaway from this section should be an awareness that there is no one-size-fits-all when it comes to security. Best and most secure approaches are not necessarily what is always needed as there is a high price to be paid with those (in terms of initial development, maintainability). It is better to ascertain what your specific situation requires in terms of security and then finding a best-fit approach.

### Simplest architecture

- ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26722936/176666084-9f3006ea-e65e-4fb8-8592-a793eb44e412.png) Initial security architecture. One front end client having the ability to get tokens using both code and client credentials grant. One of the backend services acts as a client as well(Shopping Basket service) so it can exchange the token in order to facilitate downstream service-to-service communication. Please note how Token #1 does not request any identity-related scopes because the catalog service is not interested in the identity of the user. ([source](https://excalidraw.com/#json=APEPsNt60qD1TEWX01uLV,_5mrkJLsKxCmP7oJkKY_tQ))

### One token to rule them all

- One frontend application (one OAuth2 client) and several services. One token allows access to all the services.
- Client authenticates with the IdP and uses this token to talk to all services.
- There is only one audience and it represents all the services.
- Each of the services is configured in the same way, i.e. they are all under a blanket audience.
- Downstream service to service communication is done by forwarding the token.
- Token will have one set of scopes for all services.
- Pros: simple to setup
- Cons:
  - It does not honor the Principle of least privilege. If we have another frontend application needing access to just one service, this application will still have to request the token with all the audiences and get access to all the services. If stolen, the attacker would have access to all the services.
  - Since the same token is passed to downstream services as well, client will have access to services not meant to be accessed by the client directly.
  - `sub` claim would be passed around even to services not interested in the user's identity.
- Better approaches:
  - 1: Separate token per service, each with a dedicated audience. If the targeted service needs `sub`, this can be done easily. We would still have one client requesting all these tokens.
  - 2: Separate token per service, each with a dedicated audience. Separate clients, so each client can request a dedicated token. Please note we are talking about multiple clients here, but these can still be acquired by one and the same frontend application.

#### Comparing one token and token-per-service approach

- Having a single token for all services means if it gets stolen the attacker will have access to all the services. Another problem is it might get very big if you have many services and each of them requires some other profile information - all of these would have to be in the same token.
- Having a separate token per service provides fine-grained permissions to the client: they will only have access to the requested services. If one of those tokens gets stolen, there will be less damage. However, there is a higher cost of ownership with two tokens.
- To determine which approach is better, we need to take into account the whole of the system architecture, e.g. where do these token travel and what are the chances they might be intercepted? If one token is used to talk within the company networks and the other token is used to talk across public internet, maybe it would be good to have separate tokens, so if one token gets stolen we still haven't exposed the other token. However, if both tokens have similar paths, then the advantage of having separate token per service disappears.
- Conclusion:
  - Find a good fit.
  - If you don't have an API Gateway, you could have one token with all the scopes and audiences - the problem here is the token might get very big, having to contain all the profile data needed for all the services, along with all the audiences and scopes needed for the client to function properly.
  - Another approach when not having an API Gateway, is to have multiple tokens (one token per service). This way you have a smaller attack surface, but this does increase the cost of maintaining the solution. This might be more appropriate for sensitive applications.
  - With an API Gateway you should aim to have one token (with API Gateway as audience) and appropriate scopes - this token can then be exchanged for dedicated tokens by the API Gateway (more on that below).

#### Comparing one client and multiple client approach

- It is important to note the difference between a client and an application here. We can have a widely used web application and another application that is used by employees (e.g. Event Catalog Manager application).
- Another dimension here is whether each of those applications should be represented by a single OAuth2 client or should each of these applications have a dedicated client per each token.
- Having only one client per application is a simpler approach, but having multiple clients (e.g. client per token/service) might lower the chance of the client secret getting stolen.
- Again, to determine which approach is better, we need to take into account the whole of the system architecture. Since secrets are safe in a key vault accessed by all clients, having a single client per application is probably a better approach because the security added value is small and maintaining multiple clients would incur a price without getting much benefits.
- Conclusion: one client per application is the best approach for most scenarios.

### Lock down an API without having to know the user identity

- Some services (e.g. Event Catalog) don't need to know who the user is. Nevertheless we don't want anyone to be able to talk to our API.
- Client credentials is the best approach for this. Remember to use a token store.

### Calling downstream services

- Depends whether the downstream service needs the user's identity or not. If it needs the identity, then do a token exchange. This will require implementing your own custom grant in Identity Server, or using a On-Behalf-Off grant in Azure AD.
- If the user identity is not needed, then the calling service can just do a Client Credentials grant.

### API Gateway

- A separate service passing through HTTP requests.
- Aggregate requests so front end applications don't have to be too chatty.
- Decouple the client from backend implementation by hiding internal service architecture.
- Facilitate token exchange.
- Do not put identity provider in the API Gateway. You might have new clients in the future and having the identity provider in one API Gateway will make it hard to evolve the API Gateway pattern into the Backend-For-Frontend (BFF).
- Other benefits:
  - Rate limiting
  - Caching
  - Service discovery
  - Monitoring usage, analytics, logging
  - Handling security (TLS termination)
- Architectures:
  - One gateway across all APIs. This means one gateway serves all clients as well. Potential caveat here is the single gateway might get tightly coupled with all the backend APIs and turn into a monolith. That can be mitigated by the BFF pattern.
  - BFF supports having multiple clients by catering to a specific user experience as needed by a specific frontend client (mobile or web).
- By having an API Gateway all the other services can live behind it, in a private network. This provides infrastructure security to the services, while API Gateway validates the token. API Gateway then passes on user information to the services.
- Infrastructure security also means that inside the private network there is a free-for-all: any service can communicate with any other service freely, because tokens are not used inside the network.
- The above leads us to the next question: should services ever deal with tokens or should they just believe the user information received from the API Gateway? And should we be ok with the free-for-all approach inside the network?

Authentication is done by API Gateway and services are not responsible for their own security. API Gateway passes user information through a custom header (access token included).

#### Passing user information to a microservice

- By having the API Gateway validate the token we can have all the services live in a private network, secured on an infrastructure level. However, we still need to pass in user information to interested services.
- Ocelot allows passing user information via downstream HTTP headers (`AddHeadersToRequest`). That way we can define a custom header and pass whatever data we want. Take a look at Ocelot's claims transformation feature for more details.
- Ocelot also passes the original access token via another custom header `HeaderAuthorization`.

### Improving the API Gateway Pt. 1 - scope-based routing, one token

- Please note the architecture from this section is considered good enough for production.
- The way API Gateway is created (above) means two things:
  - Gateway does token validation. User information is passed downstream through a custom header.
  - Inside the private network there is no additional security. Any client with a valid token can call anything inside the network. Besides granting too much accessibility, this approach also makes adding new clients awkward - every new client will have access to everything.
- Solution:
  - Each service should check for respective audience.
  - Gateway should check if the token is meant for itself and allow/disallow downstream access based on scope. API Gateway (Ocelot in our case) would use the scopes to restrict or allow access to specific routes. API Gateway must forward the token then, as bearer token (ditch the custom token and user id header).
  - Access token should contain audiences for each of the internal services (plus gateway itself), based on the needs of the client. Along with the audiences appropriate scopes should also be requested by the client. Adding a new client would mean allowing only needed services/audiences, per requirements.

Authentication is done by API Gateway, routing is done based on scopes, token gets forwarded to each service with the services now being responsible for checking the audience of the token.

### Improving the API Gateway Pt. 2 - token exchange

- Situation in the previous section is now production ready. For most scenarios this would be enough. However there are some downsides to it as well.
  - Token is very permissive. In a more secure scenario we might want to go with a small, less permissive token.
  - Implementation details are exposed - such a token is a good description of the internal services architecture.
- We can make the token less permissive by having only the gateway audience in there. Tokens needed by each of the services would then be retrieved by the gateway using token exchange. This approach would also stop leaking the internal details. Since there is only the gateway audience, we would have to abandon the scope-based routing approach
- To find out how to do this with Ocelot, look into `DelegatingHandler`. Make sure you exchange the access token for a new token that has only one audience, the one you are communicating with. Also make sure you store the token in a token store. More [here](https://github.com/nlivaic/SecuringMicroservicesAspNetCore/blob/main/WithGateway/Finished%20sample/GloboTicket.Gateway/DelegatingHandlers/TokenExchangeDelegatingHandler.cs#L68)

Authentication is done by API Gateway, token gets exchanged for service-specific token. New token gets sent as bearer token to each service.

### Token stores and refreshing token

- User-initiated flows (authentication code flow): use `IdentityModel.AspNetCore` library, which implements automatic token refresh and token store. Integrate it into your services by calling `.AddAccessTokenManagement()`. What it does is store access and refresh tokens in the cookie and makes sure the access token is refreshed accordingly. You make it work with `HttpClient` by calling `.AddUserAccessTokenHandler()` when you configure `HttpClient` in `ConfigureServices()`. More [here](https://github.com/nlivaic/SecuringMicroservicesAspNetCore/blob/main/WithGateway/Finished%20sample/GloboTicket.Client/Startup.cs#L41).
- Flows not initiated by the user (client credentials, token exchange): still use `IdentityModel.AspNetCore` library, but you will have to move things into and out of provided cache yourself (inject `IClientAccessTokenCache`) - make sure you have a good name for cache key. Everything is still integrated using `.AddAccessTokenManagement()`. `IClientAccessTokenCache.GetAsync()` returns the access token only if it is not expired. You will also have to check yourself if the access token is expired and execute the client credentials or exchange token flow - . Remember, this must be done on the gateway (if using exchange token flow) and all clients using client credentials. More details [here](https://github.com/nlivaic/SecuringMicroservicesAspNetCore/blob/main/WithGateway/Finished%20sample/GloboTicket.Gateway/DelegatingHandlers/TokenExchangeDelegatingHandler.cs).

### Securing asynchronous communication

- In this section we are talking about Service Bus, but the same approach should be transferrable to other messaging brokers as well.
- Basic security is for each publisher and consumer to have a Shared Access Signature (SAS) with adequate read/write permissions. However, this still allows any application in the system to access the broker if it has the SAS.
- Additional layer of security is for each publisher to send an appropriate access token for the targeted service. Of course, this would only work for the queues and not the publish-subscribe mechanisms as those rely on the publisher not knowing who the consumers are.
- Tokens would be sent along with the message (example [here](https://github.com/nlivaic/SecuringMicroservicesAspNetCore/blob/main/WithGateway/Finished%20sample/GloboTicket.Integration.Messages/IntegrationBaseMessage.cs)).
- Consumer would have to be able to read and validate the token. Important thing to note here is the message might be read some time after getting enqueued, so the access token might be expired by then. A solution to this approach is to either a) not validate the expiration date or b) to determine whether the token was valid when the message was published. Approach b) can be seen [here](https://github.com/nlivaic/SecuringMicroservicesAspNetCore/blob/main/WithGateway/Finished%20sample/GloboTicket.Services.Order/Helpers/TokenValidationService.cs).
  - One open point here: `TokenValidationService` is called every time a message is read off the queue. As part of the validation, the well-known document is fetched, which does not sound very efficient.

### HTTPS everywhere

- When using an API Gateway we can move our services to a private network, thus making them private and inaccessible from outside. This does not mean we should remove encryption from our communication. There are several reasons to keep all communication running over HTTPS:
  - Users on the network can turn malicious.
  - System on the network can turn malicious or get compromised.
  - Architecture might change and an internal network or system previously thought to be safe can became a liability.
  - Regulatory compliance.
- Best practices say we should build the necessary security mechanism in advance, thus removing uncertainty.
- Also, when designing a system and you are in doubt, it is better to err on the side of security.
